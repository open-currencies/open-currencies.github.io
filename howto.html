										<h3><a name="openaccount">How to open an OCS account?</a></h3>
										<p>To open a new account you need to start the OCS client, go to <code>Operator tasks -> Create new account</code>
										and type in the name of the new account. Note that the name provided is a local name that should be different from
										(local) account names used so far on your machine. An account is not identified by its name and also not by its owner/creator. 
										Instead an OCS account
										is essentially a pair of keys: a private key and a public key. The public key is submitted to the notary, you are currently connected to,
										for registration, while the private key remains on your machine. 
										The public key is used to distinguish this account from other accounts, but
										also to verify transactions and other entries signed with the private key that should remain known to you only.</p>
										<p>To verify that your account was successfully created and the public key submitted and notarized go to 
										<code>Operator tasks -> Show account info</code>. You should be able to display basic information regarding your 
										newly created account and to recover
										the account's ID (Key Id). This ID is sufficient to identify your account, in particular to perform transfers to it.
										<p>Note that account movements for all OCS accounts are public, it is, however, not public who the owner of a given account is. 
										You remain
										anonymous as the owner of your account unless you choose to make this information public. You can set up and manage
										arbitrarily many accounts.</p>

										<h3><a name="getfunding">How to apply for funding in a currency?</a></h3>
										<p>To apply for the financing of an economic operation you first need to find the currency, in which you will request funds, under
										 <code>Operator tasks -> Show liquidity info</code>.
										Choose the name of the currency or insert the ID of the respective currency (if known). Once the parameters and description
										of the currency are displayed click on <code>APPLY FOR LIQUIDITY</code>. Next fill in the form and submit your proposal. Make sure that the description part
										is not bigger than 1.5 MB.<br>
										Note that your proposal must follow the guidelines defined in the currency description. Otherwise it is unlikely to be approved.<br>
										An application that is ignored is automatically rejected after some time without you getting any feedback. Please make sure to include an e-mail address
										and/or other contact details to your submissions to allow interested community members to give you feedback.</p>

										<h3><a name="addaccount">How to add someone else's account to my client?</a></h3>
										<p>In order to add someone's account to your client you need to know the ID (Key Id) of the respective account and, ideally,
										also its hash value.<br>
										Go to <code>Operator tasks -> Show account info</code> and insert the ID. Once the account has been found and its
										data has been displayed you should check the hash value to make sure that you are dealing with the right account.
										Then click on <code>ASSIGN NAME</code> and type in the name under which you want the client
										to denote this account in the future. If after doing so you close the account info window and reopen it via 
										<code>Operator tasks -> Show account info</code> the account name should now be listed directly under <code>Account</code>.</p>

										<h3><a name="transfer">How to make transfers with OCS?</a></h3>
										<p>Before being able to make transfers to someone else's account you must first <a href="#addaccount">add it</a> to your client.<br>
										To transfer liquidity in either a currency or an obligation go to <code>Operator tasks -> Transfer liquidity</code> and fill in the
										form. </p>
										<p>If you want someone else to transfer liquidity to your account, e.g. in return for a good or service, you can place a 
										so-called transfer
										request: Go to <code>Operator tasks -> Request liquidity -> Create new request</code> and fill in the form. After this you should be able to 
										determine the ID of the newly created request via <code>Operator tasks -> Request liquidity -> Show existing requests</code>.
										This ID is then copied and sent to the person or group of people who you expect to satisfy this particular request. </p>
										<p>In order to fulfill a given transfer request go to <code>Operator tasks -> Show transaction info</code> and insert
										the ID of the transfer request. Once the information has been displayed click on 
										<code>SATISFY THIS REQUEST</code> and fill in the form.</p>

										<h3><a name="exchange">How to exchange liquidity?</a></h3>
										<p>For the purpose of exchanging some amount in a given currency or obligation into an amount of another currency or obligation you
										can either find and accept an existing exchange offer or place an exchange offer yourself.</p>
										<p>For the first option go to <code>Operator tasks -> Exchange liquidity -> Show existing offers</code> and fill in the form to
										search for existing offers. In order to accept any of the offers displayed copy the respective ID and go to 
										<code>Operator tasks -> Show transaction info</code> and insert the ID. After the data concerning this offer has been displayed
										click on <code>ACCEPT THIS OFFER</code> and fill in the form.</p>
										<p>In order to place a new offer go to <code>Operator tasks -> Exchange liquidity -> Create new offer</code> and fill in the
										form. After this you should verify that the offer was successfully notarized by being able to find it under
										<code>Operator tasks -> Exchange liquidity -> Show existing offers</code>. In order to delete the offer determine and copy its ID
										and go to <code>Operator tasks -> Show transaction info</code>. Insert the ID and request data concerning the offer.
										Then click on <code>ACCEPT THIS OFFER</code> and choose your account as the source account. Finally, click on 
										<code>Delete offer</code>.</p>

										<h3><a name="portaccount">How to port an account to another client?</a></h3>
										<p>When using different instances of the OCS client (e.g. on different machines) you can port an account from a client A to a client B
										using the following procedure: </p>
										<p>First make sure that neither of the clients is running. Now open the directory <code>conf/keys</code> in the directory
										of client A. Assume we want to port an account named "AccountXYZ" (local name used by client A) that you happen to be the owner of. 
										Then the directory <code>conf/keys</code> should contain the file <code>AccountXYZ.PRVTkey</code>.
										Now copy this file to the directory <code>conf/keys</code> of client B. Before proceeding further you may rename the new file to any name
										you like, e.g. <code>AccountABC.PRVTkey</code>, but make sure that the file still ends with <code>.PRVTkey</code> and that the new name is not already used
										in client B for another account. Now start client B. After a few seconds the newly added account should be listed under <code>Account</code>
										when opening <code>Operator tasks -> Show account info</code>.</p>
										<p>The above procedure can also be performed for a <code>.PBLCkey</code> file instead of a <code>.PRVTkey</code> file. 
										However, in this case you will not be able to make transfers from that
										account with client B and the account will be treated as someone else's account.</p>

										the currency's description click on <code>APPLY FOR REFEREE STATUS</code> and fill in the form. Make sure that the description part
										is not bigger than 1.5 MB.
										Note that your application must follow the guidelines defined in the currency description. Otherwise it is unlikely to be approved.<br>
										An application that is ignored is automatically rejected after some time without you getting any feedback. Please make sure to include an e-mail address

										Now fill in the form making sure that the description part is not bigger than 1.5 MB.<br>
										Note that as a notary you must be knowledgeable about the protocols and procedures used in the technical implementation of the OCS as described
